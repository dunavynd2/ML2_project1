Variable REDUCTION and PCA

1. Columns = Variables
    a. collinearirty issues
        i. 
    b. model instability
        i. 
2. Principle Component Analysis
    a. Dimension reduction technique that creates variables (that are weighted linear combinations of orignal variables) called Principal Components
    b. Creates as many components as there are input variables (sum of variance of components = 100%) 
    c. performs an eigenvalue decomposition of a correlation or covariance matrix
    d. creates components that consolidate more of the explained variance into the first few Principal Components(PCs) that in any variable in the original data
